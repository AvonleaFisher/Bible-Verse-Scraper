# Bible Verse Scraper
This repository's notebook contains functions to retrieve New and Old Testament verses from [The Bible in Basic English](https://www.biblestudytools.com/bbe/), which is in the public domain. The functions were created to support the development of a homeschool curriculum project aimed at exploring the Bible as literature. 

The first function, `get_chapters()`, returns entire chapters given a list of chapters and a book name. The second function, `get_verses()` takes in a book name, a chapter, and a verse range (as a list or tuple) as arguments. It returns the specified verses.
