# Bible Verse Scraper
This repository's notebook contains functions to retrieve New and Old Testament verses from [The Bible in Basic English](https://www.biblestudytools.com/bbe/), which is in the public domain. The functions were created to support the development of a homeschool curriculum project aimed at understanding the Bible as literature.
